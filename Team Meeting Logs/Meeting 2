Notes from TA meeting 4/17:

Make sure we keep consistent commits throughout the week.
Nikita thoughts-
We are at a very good spot currently having our login and register page working and the header and footer both look good. In the future we should continue working on the rest of our pages using our API. The way we formatted the pages makes everything simple enough for the user but still feels like a complete website.
