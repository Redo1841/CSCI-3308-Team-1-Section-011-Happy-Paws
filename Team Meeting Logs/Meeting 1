Notes from TA meeting 4/10:
Release notes are just simple sentence or two about new features added weekly
3 commits a week for each person. The commits don't have to be super large and can make 3 commits when working on the same commits. Also all 3 can be on the same day.

Nikita thoughts-
having the main landing page as the register page makes the need for a home page not completely necessary. Having the discover page work as a 2 in 1 home page/main page.
We need to have our registration and login made for the lab next week.
